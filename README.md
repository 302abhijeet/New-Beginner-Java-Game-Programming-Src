##Source Code
======================================

The "New Beginner Java Game Programming Tutorial Series" is a YouTube tutorial series, by CodeNMore, on how to make a 2d game, in Java, from scratch. To check it out, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLah6faXAgguMnTBs3JnEJY0shAc18XYQZ)!

The source code for each episode in the series can be found here. Look in this repository and select the folder that corresponds to the episode number you are looking for.  Within that folder is my own Eclipse project folder, though you don't need Eclipse to view any of the source code or run it.
